\title{Calculate recruitment pattern of lfq object}
\usage{
recruitment(lfq, Lrecr = NA, tincr = 0.01, use.rcounts = FALSE,
  plot = TRUE, hide.progressbar = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{lfq}{a length-frequency object (i.e. class \code{lfq}) that contains
a \code{lfq$par} slot with \code{\link{VBGF}} parameters (usually fit
via \code{\link{ELEFAN}}, \code{\link{ELEFAN_GA}}, or \code{\link{ELEFAN_SA}}
functions).}

\item{Lrecr}{numeric. Length at recruitment
(default: \code{Lrecr = NA} assumes Lrecr = 0, but plot emphasizes
relative months).}

\item{tincr}{resolution to use for hindcasting time at recruitment
(default: \code{tincr = 0.01})}

\item{use.rcounts}{logical. Should restructured counts
(\code{lfq$rcounts}),
rather than raw catch counts (\code{lfq$catch}) be used to derive
recruitment pattern. If true, only bins with positive restructures
frequencies are considered, and those values are multiplied by 100
in order to provide appropriate scaling for density approxmations via
\code{\link[graphics]{hist}}.}

\item{plot}{logical. Should monthly recruitment pattern [\%] by plotted
as a \code{\link[graphics]{barplot}} (default: \code{plot = TRUE}).}

\item{hide.progressbar}{logical. Should progress bar be displayed
(default: \code{hide.progressbar = FALSE})}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to
\code{\link[graphics]{barplot}} when \code{plot = TRUE}.}
}
\value{
object of "histogram" class containing
monthly recruitment pattern
}
\description{
\code{recruitment} calculates the recruitment pattern (i.e. monthly)
of an lfq object given corresponding \code{\link{VBGF}} parameters
and a defined length at recruitment (\code{Lrecr} (Default:
\code{Lrecr = NA} assumes Lrecr = 0, but plot emphasizes relative months)
Time at recruitment \code{trecr} is calculated via a hindcast
using the \code{\link{calc_trecr}} function.
}
\details{
This function does not represent a robust statistical method as it
assumes the same growth parameters for all individual counts
in the lfq count bins.
Nevertheless, the results should provide general information about
the recruitment pattern, e.g. relative recruitment strength by month.
Using the argument \code{use.rcounts = TRUE}, the analysis represents
a hindcast of positive restructured frequencies only.

From Gayanilo et al (2005):
"The results generated by this routine should be treated
as approximations because, while allowing statements on
the number of annual pulses and on their relative strength,
this model is based on two assumptions that are rarely met
in reality: (i) all fish in the sample grow as described
by a single set of growth parameters...
When using restructured data, the temporal spread reduces
and thus probably better reflects the actual seasonality
of recruitment."

Contrary to the method used in FiSAT, which produces either
a single or mixture of Gaussian distributions, the output
of this function is simply count data and corresponding densities
by month. Therefore it is possible to have densities for each
month, which is not the case in FiSAT.
